# Responsive Menu Website with Dynamic Content Integration  

## Overview  
This repository contains the final project for **Module 5** of the *"HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers"* course on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University. The project focuses on developing a **responsive menu website** for a Japanese restaurant, featuring dynamically loaded content using **AJAX** and **JSON**. The module emphasizes applying JavaScript within the context of a web page to interact with the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and server-side data.  

## Key Concepts Covered  
- DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript  
- Introduction to **AJAX** and handling HTTP requests  
- Parsing and processing **JSON** data  
- Dynamic content loading without page reload  
- Connecting to a backend service for real-time data fetching  

## Project Features  
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices  
- Dynamic menu content populated through AJAX requests  
- Interactive navigation with real-time updates  
- Visual assets, including images and icons, enhancing the restaurant's branding
